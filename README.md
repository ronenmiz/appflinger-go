There is also a C client SDK (available in binary form), a [Javascript client SDK](https://github.com/ronenmiz/appflinger-js), and a [C# client SDK](https://github.com/ronenmiz/appflinger-mediaroom), as well as a full client implementation for the Raspberry Pi (please contact TVersity for more information). 

The server side code is closed source and is available for licensing from TVersity.

### What is AppFlinger?

AppFlinger (www.appflinger.com) is a [cloud browser](https://www.w3.org/TR/cloud-browser-arch/), i.e. it is an HTML5 browser (based on [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home)) running in the cloud and delivered to client devices as a video or image stream.

AppFlinger is a server side technology that can be deployed in the cloud or on-premise and be utilized for delivering a consistent HTML5 content experience to any device, in a hardware agnostic manner.

AppFlinger physically [isolates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_isolation) edge devices and edge networks from the content they are rendering, thus enabling next generation security while delivering on the promise of any content on any device.

### AppFlinger Uniqueness

AppFlinger is unique in its ability to deliver desktop grade HTML5 browser experience to any networked device with a video player, while requiring very low bandwidth and CPU on the server.
